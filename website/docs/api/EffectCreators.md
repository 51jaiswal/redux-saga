# Effect Creators

> Notes:
> - Each function below returns a plain JavaScript object and does not perform any execution.
> - The execution is performed by the middleware during the Iteration process described above.
> - The middleware examines each Effect description and performs the appropriate action.

### `take(pattern)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified action on the Store.
The Generator is suspended until an action that matches `pattern` is dispatched.

The result of `yield take(pattern)` is an action object being dispatched.

`pattern` is interpreted using the following rules:

- If `take` is called with no arguments or `'*'` all dispatched actions are matched (e.g. `take()` will match all actions)

- If it is a function, the action is matched if `pattern(action)` is true (e.g. `take(action => action.entities)` will match all actions having a (truthy) `entities` field.)
> Note: if the pattern function has `toString` defined on it, `action.type` will be tested against `pattern.toString()` instead. This is useful if you're using an action creator library like redux-act or redux-actions.

- If it is a String, the action is matched if `action.type === pattern` (e.g. `take(INCREMENT_ASYNC)`

- If it is an array, each item in the array is matched with aforementioned rules, so the mixed array of strings and function predicates is supported. The most common use case is an array of strings though, so that `action.type` is matched against all items in the array (e.g. `take([INCREMENT, DECREMENT])` and that would match either actions of type `INCREMENT` or `DECREMENT`).

The middleware provides a special action `END`. If you dispatch the END action, then all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will be terminated regardless of the specified pattern. If the terminated Saga has still some forked tasks which are still running, it will wait for all the child tasks to terminate before terminating the Task.

### `takeMaybe(pattern)`

Same as `take(pattern)` but does not automatically terminate the Saga on an `END` action. Instead all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will get the `END` object.

#### Notes

`takeMaybe` got its name from the FP analogy - it's like instead of having a return type of `ACTION` (with automatic handling) we can have a type of `Maybe(ACTION)` so we can handle both cases:

- case when there is a `Just(ACTION)` (we have an action)
- the case of `NOTHING` (channel was closed*). i.e. we need some way to map over `END`

* internally all `dispatch`ed actions are going through the `stdChannel` which is getting closed when `dispatch(END)` happens

### `take(channel)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified message from the provided Channel. If the channel is already closed, then the Generator will immediately terminate following the same process described above for `take(pattern)`.

### `takeMaybe(channel)`

Same as `take(channel)` but does not automatically terminate the Saga on an `END` action. Instead all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will get the `END` object. See more [here](#takemaybepattern)

### `takeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args)`

Spawns a `saga` on each action dispatched to the Store that matches `pattern`.

- `pattern: String | Array | Function` - for more information see docs for [`take(pattern)`](#takepattern)

- `saga: Function` - a Generator function

- `args: Array<any>` - arguments to be passed to the started task. `takeEvery` will add the incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to `saga`)

#### Example

In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchUser`. We use `takeEvery` to start a new `fetchUser` task on each dispatched `USER_REQUESTED` action:

```javascript
import { takeEvery } from `redux-saga/effects`

function* fetchUser(action) {
  ...
}

function* watchFetchUser() {
  yield takeEvery('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)
}
```

#### Notes

`takeEvery` is a high-level API built using `take` and `fork`. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects

```javascript
const takeEvery = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) => fork(function*() {
  while (true) {
    const action = yield take(patternOrChannel)
    yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))
  }
})
```

`takeEvery` allows concurrent actions to be handled. In the example above, when a `USER_REQUESTED`
action is dispatched, a new `fetchUser` task is started even if a previous `fetchUser` is still pending
(for example, the user clicks on a `Load User` button 2 consecutive times at a rapid rate, the 2nd
click will dispatch a `USER_REQUESTED` action while the `fetchUser` fired on the first one hasn't yet terminated)

`takeEvery` doesn't handle out of order responses from tasks. There is no guarantee that the tasks will
terminate in the same order they were started. To handle out of order responses, you may consider `takeLatest`
below.

### `takeEvery(channel, saga, ...args)`

You can also pass in a channel as argument and the behaviour is the same as [takeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args)](#takeeverypattern-saga-args).

### `takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args)`

Forks a `saga` on each action dispatched to the Store that matches `pattern`. And automatically cancels
any previous `saga` task started previously if it's still running.

Each time an action is dispatched to the store. And if this action matches `pattern`, `takeLatest`
starts a new `saga` task in the background. If a `saga` task was started previously (on the last action dispatched
before the actual action), and if this task is still running, the task will be cancelled.

- `pattern: String | Array | Function` - for more information see docs for [`take(pattern)`](#takepattern)

- `saga: Function` - a Generator function

- `args: Array<any>` - arguments to be passed to the started task. `takeLatest` will add the
incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to `saga`)

#### Example

In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchUser`. We use `takeLatest` to
start a new `fetchUser` task on each dispatched `USER_REQUESTED` action. Since `takeLatest`
cancels any pending task started previously, we ensure that if a user triggers multiple consecutive
`USER_REQUESTED` actions rapidly, we'll only conclude with the latest action

```javascript
import { takeLatest } from `redux-saga/effects`

function* fetchUser(action) {
  ...
}

function* watchLastFetchUser() {
  yield takeLatest('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)
}
```

#### Notes

`takeLatest` is a high-level API built using `take` and `fork`. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects

```javascript
const takeLatest = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) => fork(function*() {
  let lastTask
  while (true) {
    const action = yield take(patternOrChannel)
    if (lastTask) {
      yield cancel(lastTask) // cancel is no-op if the task has already terminated
    }
    lastTask = yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))
  }
})
```

### `takeLatest(channel, saga, ...args)`

You can also pass in a channel as argument and the behaviour is the same as [takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args)](#takelatestpattern-saga-args).

### `takeLeading(pattern, saga, ...args)`

Spawns a `saga` on each action dispatched to the Store that matches `pattern`.
After spawning a task once, it blocks until spawned saga completes and then starts to listen for a `pattern` again.

In short, `takeLeading` is listening for the actions when it doesn't run a saga.

- `pattern: String | Array | Function` - for more information see docs for [`take(pattern)`](#takepattern)

- `saga: Function` - a Generator function

- `args: Array<any>` - arguments to be passed to the started task. `takeLeading` will add the
incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to `saga`)

#### Example

In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchUser`. We use `takeLeading` to
start a new `fetchUser` task on each dispatched `USER_REQUESTED` action. Since `takeLeading`
ignores any new coming task after it's started, we ensure that if a user triggers multiple consecutive
`USER_REQUESTED` actions rapidly, we'll only keep on running with the leading action

```javascript
import { takeLeading } from `redux-saga/effects`

function* fetchUser(action) {
  ...
}

function* watchLastFetchUser() {
  yield takeLeading('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)
}
```

#### Notes

`takeLeading` is a high-level API built using `take` and `call`. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects

```javascript
const takeLeading = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) => fork(function*() {
  while (true) {
    const action = yield take(patternOrChannel);
    yield call(saga, ...args.concat(action));
  }
})
```

### `takeLeading(channel, saga, ...args)`

You can also pass in a channel as argument and the behavior is the same as [takeLeading(pattern, saga, ...args)](#takeleadingpattern-saga-args).

### `put(action)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to schedule the dispatching of an action to the store. This dispatch may not be immediate since other tasks might lie ahead in the saga task queue or still be in progress.

You can, however, expect the store to be updated in the current stack frame (i.e. by the next line of code after `yield put(action)`) unless you have other Redux middlewares with asynchronous flows that delay the propagation of the action.

Downstream errors (e.g. from the reducer) will be bubbled up.

- `action: Object` - [see Redux `dispatch` documentation for complete info](https://redux.js.org/api/store#dispatchaction)

### `putResolve(action)`

Just like [`put`](#putaction) but the effect is blocking (if promise is returned from `dispatch` it will wait for its resolution) and will bubble up errors from downstream.

- `action: Object` - [see Redux `dispatch` documentation for complete info](https://redux.js.org/api/store/#dispatchaction)

### `put(channel, action)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to put an action into the provided channel.

- `channel: Channel` - a [`Channel`](#channel) Object.
- `action: Object` - [see Redux `dispatch` documentation for complete info](https://redux.js.org/api/store/#dispatchaction)

This effect is blocking if the put is *not* buffered but immediately consumed by takers. If an error
is thrown in any of these takers it will bubble back into the saga.

### `call(fn, ...args)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function `fn` with `args` as arguments.

- `fn: Function` - A Generator function, or normal function which either returns a Promise as result, or any other value.
- `args: Array<any>` - An array of values to be passed as arguments to `fn`

#### Notes

`fn` can be either a *normal* or a Generator function.

The middleware invokes the function and examines its result.

If the result is an Iterator object, the middleware will run that Generator function, just like it did with the
startup Generators (passed to the middleware on startup). The parent Generator will be
suspended until the child Generator terminates normally, in which case the parent Generator
is resumed with the value returned by the child Generator. Or until the child aborts with some
error, in which case an error will be thrown inside the parent Generator.

If `fn` is a normal function and returns a Promise, the middleware will suspend the Generator until the Promise is
settled. After the promise is resolved the Generator is resumed with the resolved value, or if the Promise
is rejected an error is thrown inside the Generator.

If the result is not an Iterator object nor a Promise, the middleware will immediately return that value back to the saga,
so that it can resume its execution synchronously.

When an error is thrown inside the Generator, if it has a `try/catch` block surrounding the
current `yield` instruction, the control will be passed to the `catch` block. Otherwise,
the Generator aborts with the raised error, and if this Generator was called by another
Generator, the error will propagate to the calling Generator.

### `call([context, fn], ...args)`

Same as `call(fn, ...args)` but supports passing a `this` context to `fn`. This is useful to
invoke object methods.

### `call([context, fnName], ...args)`

Same as `call([context, fn], ...args)` but supports passing a `fn` as string. Useful for invoking object's methods, i.e. `yield call([localStorage, 'getItem'], 'redux-saga')`

### `call({context, fn}, ...args)`

Same as `call([context, fn], ...args)` but supports passing `context` and `fn` as properties of an object, i.e. `yield call({context: localStorage, fn: localStorage.getItem}, 'redux-saga')`. `fn` can be a string or a function.

### `apply(context, fn, [args])`

Alias for `call([context, fn], ...args)`.

### `cps(fn, ...args)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to invoke `fn` as a Node style function.

- `fn: Function` - a Node style function. i.e. a function which accepts in addition to its arguments,
an additional callback to be invoked by `fn` when it terminates. The callback accepts two parameters,
where the first parameter is used to report errors while the second is used to report successful results

- `args: Array<any>` - an array to be passed as arguments for `fn`

#### Notes

The middleware will perform a call `fn(...arg, cb)`. The `cb` is a callback passed by the middleware to
`fn`. If `fn` terminates normally, it must call `cb(null, result)` to notify the middleware
of a successful result. If `fn` encounters some error, then it must call `cb(error)` in order to
notify the middleware that an error has occurred.

The middleware remains suspended until `fn` terminates.

### `cps([context, fn], ...args)`

Supports passing a `this` context to `fn` (object method invocation)

### `cps({context, fn}, ...args)`

Same as `cps([context, fn], ...args)` but supports passing `context` and `fn` as properties of an object. `fn` can be a string or a function.

### `fork(fn, ...args)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to perform a *non-blocking call* on `fn`

#### Arguments

- `fn: Function` - A Generator function, or normal function which returns a Promise as result
- `args: Array<any>` - An array of values to be passed as arguments to `fn`

returns a [Task](#task) object.

#### Notes

`fork`, like `call`, can be used to invoke both normal and Generator functions. But, the calls are
non-blocking, the middleware doesn't suspend the Generator while waiting for the result of `fn`.
Instead as soon as `fn` is invoked, the Generator resumes immediately.

`fork`, alongside `race`, is a central Effect for managing concurrency between Sagas.

The result of `yield fork(fn ...args)` is a [Task](#task) object.  An object with some useful
methods and properties.

All forked tasks are *attached* to their parents. When the parent terminates the execution of its
own body of instructions, it will wait for all forked tasks to terminate before returning.

#### Error propagation
Errors from child tasks automatically bubble up to their parents. If any forked task raises an uncaught error, then
the parent task will abort with the child Error, and the whole Parent's execution tree (i.e. forked tasks + the
*main task* represented by the parent's body if it's still running) will be cancelled.

Cancellation of a forked Task will automatically cancel all forked tasks that are still executing. It'll
also cancel the current Effect where the cancelled task was blocked (if any).

If a forked task fails *synchronously* (ie: fails immediately after its execution before performing any
async operation), then no Task is returned, instead the parent will be aborted as soon as possible (since both
parent and child execute in parallel, the parent will abort as soon as it takes notice of the child failure).

To create *detached* forks, use `spawn` instead.

### `fork([context, fn], ...args)`

Supports invoking forked functions with a `this` context

### `fork({context, fn}, ...args)`

Same as `fork([context, fn], ...args)` but supports passing `context` and `fn` as properties of an object. `fn` can be a string or a function.

### `spawn(fn, ...args)`

Same as `fork(fn, ...args)` but creates a *detached* task. A detached task remains independent from its parent and acts like
a top-level task. The parent will not wait for detached tasks to terminate before returning and all events which may affect the
parent or the detached task are completely independents (error, cancellation).

### `spawn([context, fn], ...args)`

Supports spawning functions with a `this` context

### `join(task)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for the result
of a previously forked task.

- `task: Task` - A [Task](#task) object returned by a previous `fork`

#### Notes

`join` will resolve to the same outcome of the joined task (success or error). If the joined
task is cancelled, the cancellation will also propagate to the Saga executing the join
effect. Similarly, any potential callers of those joiners will be cancelled as well.

### `join([...tasks])`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for the results of previously forked tasks.

- `tasks: Array<Task>` - A [Task](#task) is the object returned by a previous `fork`

#### Notes

It wraps the array of tasks in [join effects](#jointask), roughly becoming the equivalent of
`yield tasks.map(t => join(t))`.

### `cancel(task)`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a previously forked task.

- `task: Task` - A [Task](#task) object returned by a previous `fork`

#### Notes

To cancel a running task, the middleware will invoke `return` on the underlying Generator
object. This will cancel the current Effect in the task and jump to the finally block (if defined).

Inside the finally block, you can execute any cleanup logic or dispatch some action to keep the
store in a consistent state (e.g. reset the state of a spinner to false when an ajax request
is cancelled). You can check inside the finally block if a Saga was cancelled by issuing
a `yield cancelled()`.

Cancellation propagates downward to child sagas. When cancelling a task, the middleware will also
cancel the current Effect (where the task is currently blocked). If the current Effect
is a call to another Saga, it will be also cancelled. When cancelling a Saga, all *attached
forks* (sagas forked using `yield fork()`) will be cancelled. This means that cancellation
effectively affects the whole execution tree that belongs to the cancelled task.

`cancel` is a non-blocking Effect. i.e. the Saga executing it will resume immediately after
performing the cancellation.

For functions which return Promise results, you can plug your own cancellation logic
by attaching a `[CANCEL]` to the promise.

The following example shows how to attach cancellation logic to a Promise result:

```javascript
import { CANCEL } from 'redux-saga'
import { fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'

function myApi() {
  const promise = myXhr(...)

  promise[CANCEL] = () => myXhr.abort()
  return promise
}

function* mySaga() {

  const task = yield fork(myApi)

  // ... later
  // will call promise[CANCEL] on the result of myApi
  yield cancel(task)
}
```

redux-saga will automatically cancel jqXHR objects using their `abort` method.

### `cancel([...tasks])`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel previously forked tasks.

- `tasks: Array<Task>` - A [Task](#task) is the object returned by a previous `fork`

#### Notes

It wraps the array of tasks in [cancel effects](#canceltask), roughly becoming the equivalent of
`yield tasks.map(t => cancel(t))`.

### `cancel()`

Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a task in which it has been yielded (self-cancellation).
It allows to reuse destructor-like logic inside a `finally` blocks for both outer (`cancel(task)`) and self (`cancel()`) cancellations.

#### Example

```javascript
function* deleteRecord({ payload }) {
  try {
    const { confirm, deny } = yield call(prompt);
    if (confirm) {
      yield put(actions.deleteRecord.confirmed())
    }
    if (deny) {
      yield cancel()
    }
  } catch(e) {
    // handle failure
  } finally {
    if (yield cancelled()) {
      // shared cancellation logic
      yield put(actions.deleteRecord.cancel(payload))
    }
  }
}
```

### `select(selector, ...args)`

Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to invoke the provided selector on the
current Store's state (i.e. returns the result of `selector(getState(), ...args)`).

- `selector: Function` - a function `(state, ...args) => args`. It takes the
current state and optionally some arguments and returns a slice of the current Store's state

- `args: Array<any>` - optional arguments to be passed to the selector in addition of `getState`.

If `select` is called without argument (i.e. `yield select()`) then the effect is resolved
with the entire state (the same result of a `getState()` call).

> It's important to note that when an action is dispatched to the store, the middleware first
forwards the action to the reducers and then notifies the Sagas. This means that when you query the
Store's State, you get the State **after** the action has been applied.
> However, this behavior is only guaranteed if all subsequent middlewares call `next(action)` synchronously.  If any subsequent middleware calls `next(action)` asynchronously (which is unusual but possible), then the sagas will get the state from **before** the action is applied.  Therefore it is recommended to review the source of each subsequent middleware to ensure it calls `next(action)` synchronously, or else ensure that redux-saga is the last middleware in the call chain.

#### Notes

Preferably, a Saga should be autonomous and should not depend on the Store's state. This makes
it easy to modify the state implementation without affecting the Saga code. A saga should preferably
depend only on its own internal control state when possible. But sometimes, one could
find it more convenient for a Saga to query the state instead of maintaining the needed data by itself
(for example, when a Saga duplicates the logic of invoking some reducer to compute a state that was
already computed by the Store).

For example, suppose we have this state shape in our application:

```javascript
state = {
  cart: {...}
}
```

We can create a *selector*, i.e. a function which knows how to extract the `cart` data from the State:

`./selectors`
```javascript
export const getCart = state => state.cart
```

Then we can use that selector from inside a Saga using the `select` Effect:

`./sagas.js`
```javascript
import { take, fork, select } from 'redux-saga/effects'
import { getCart } from './selectors'

function* checkout() {
  // query the state using the exported selector
  const cart = yield select(getCart)

  // ... call some API endpoint then dispatch a success/error action
}

export default function* rootSaga() {
  while (true) {
    yield take('CHECKOUT_REQUEST')
    yield fork(checkout)
  }
}
```

`checkout` can get the needed information directly by using `select(getCart)`. The Saga is coupled only with the `getCart` selector. If we have many Sagas (or React Components) that needs to access the `cart` slice, they will all be coupled to the same function `getCart`. And if we now change the state shape, we need only to update `getCart`.

### `actionChannel(pattern, [buffer])`

Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to queue the actions matching `pattern` using an event channel. Optionally, you can provide a buffer to control buffering of the queued actions.

- `pattern:` - see API for `take(pattern)`
- `buffer: Buffer` - a [Buffer](#buffer) object

#### Example

The following code creates a channel to buffer all `USER_REQUEST` actions. Note that even the Saga may be blocked
on the `call` effect. All actions that come while it's blocked are automatically buffered. This causes the Saga
to execute the API calls one at a time

```javascript
import { actionChannel, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'
import api from '...'

function* takeOneAtMost() {
  const chan = yield actionChannel('USER_REQUEST')
  while (true) {
    const {payload} = yield take(chan)
    yield call(api.getUser, payload)
  }
}
```

### `flush(channel)`

Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to flush all buffered items from the channel. Flushed items are returned back to the saga, so they can be utilized if needed.

- `channel: Channel` - a [`Channel`](#channel) Object.

#### Example

```javascript

function* saga() {
  const chan = yield actionChannel('ACTION')

  try {
    while (true) {
      const action = yield take(chan)
      // ...
    }
  } finally {
    const actions = yield flush(chan)
    // ...
  }

}
```

### `cancelled()`

Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to return whether this generator has been cancelled. Typically
you use this Effect in a finally block to run Cancellation specific code

#### Example

```javascript

function* saga() {
  try {
    // ...
  } finally {
    if (yield cancelled()) {
      // logic that should execute only on Cancellation
    }
    // logic that should execute in all situations (e.g. closing a channel)
  }
}
```

### `setContext(props)`

Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to update its own context. This effect extends
saga's context instead of replacing it.

### `getContext(prop)`

Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to return a specific property of saga's context.

### `delay(ms, [val])`

Returns an effect descriptor to block execution for `ms` milliseconds and return `val` value.

### `throttle(ms, pattern, saga, ...args)`

Spawns a `saga` on an action dispatched to the Store that matches `pattern`. After spawning a task it's still accepting incoming actions into the underlying `buffer`, keeping at most 1 (the most recent one), but in the same time holding up with spawning new task for `ms` milliseconds (hence its name - `throttle`). Purpose of this is to ignore incoming actions for a given period of time while processing a task.

- `ms: Number` - length of a time window in milliseconds during which actions will be ignored after the action starts processing

- `pattern: String | Array | Function` - for more information see docs for [`take(pattern)`](#takepattern)

- `saga: Function` - a Generator function

- `args: Array<any>` - arguments to be passed to the started task. `throttle` will add the
incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to `saga`)

#### Example

In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchAutocomplete`. We use `throttle` to
start a new `fetchAutocomplete` task on dispatched `FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE` action. However since `throttle` ignores consecutive `FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE` for some time, we ensure that user won't flood our server with requests.

```javascript
import { call, put, throttle } from `redux-saga/effects`

function* fetchAutocomplete(action) {
  const autocompleteProposals = yield call(Api.fetchAutocomplete, action.text)
  yield put({type: 'FETCHED_AUTOCOMPLETE_PROPOSALS', proposals: autocompleteProposals})
}

function* throttleAutocomplete() {
  yield throttle(1000, 'FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE', fetchAutocomplete)
}
```

#### Notes

`throttle` is a high-level API built using `take`, `fork` and `actionChannel`. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects

```javascript
const throttle = (ms, pattern, task, ...args) => fork(function*() {
  const throttleChannel = yield actionChannel(pattern, buffers.sliding(1))

  while (true) {
    const action = yield take(throttleChannel)
    yield fork(task, ...args, action)
    yield delay(ms)
  }
})
```

### `throttle(ms, channel, saga, ...args)`
You can also handle a channel as argument and the behaviour is the same as [`throttle(ms, pattern, saga, ..args)`](#throttlems-pattern-saga-args)

### `debounce(ms, pattern, saga, ...args)`

Spawns a `saga` on an action dispatched to the Store that matches `pattern`. Saga will be called after it stops taking `pattern` actions for `ms` milliseconds. Purpose of this is to prevent calling saga until the actions are settled off.

- `ms: Number` - defines how many milliseconds should elapse since the last time `pattern` action was fired to call the `saga`

- `pattern: String | Array | Function` - for more information see docs for [`take(pattern)`](#takepattern)

- `saga: Function` - a Generator function

- `args: Array<any>` - arguments to be passed to the started task. `debounce` will add the
incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to `saga`)

#### Example

In the following example, we create a basic task `fetchAutocomplete`. We use `debounce` to
delay calling `fetchAutocomplete` saga until we stop receive any `FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE` events for at least `1000` ms.

```javascript
import { call, put, debounce } from `redux-saga/effects`

function* fetchAutocomplete(action) {
  const autocompleteProposals = yield call(Api.fetchAutocomplete, action.text)
  yield put({type: 'FETCHED_AUTOCOMPLETE_PROPOSALS', proposals: autocompleteProposals})
}

function* debounceAutocomplete() {
  yield debounce(1000, 'FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE', fetchAutocomplete)
}
```

#### Notes

`debounce` is a high-level API built using `take`, `delay`, `race` and `fork`. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects

```javascript
const debounce = (ms, pattern, task, ...args) => fork(function*() {
  while (true) {
    let action = yield take(pattern)

    while (true) {
      const { debounced, latestAction } = yield race({
        debounced: delay(ms),
        latestAction: take(pattern)
      })

      if (debounced) {
        yield fork(task, ...args, action)
        break
      }

      action = latestAction
    }
  }
})
```

### `debounce(ms, channel, saga, ...args)`
You can also handle a channel as argument and the behaviour is the same as [`debounce(ms, pattern, saga, ..args)`](#debouncems-pattern-saga-args)

### `retry(maxTries, delay, fn, ...args)`
Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function `fn` with `args` as arguments.
In case of failure will try to make another call after `delay` milliseconds, if a number of attempts < `maxTries`.

- `maxTries: Number` - maximum calls count.
- `delay: Number` - length of a time window in milliseconds between `fn` calls.
- `fn: Function` - A Generator function, or normal function which either returns a Promise as a result, or any other value.
- `args: Array<any>` - An array of values to be passed as arguments to `fn`

#### Example

In the following example, we create a basic task `retrySaga`. We use `retry` to try to fetch our API 3 times with 10 second interval. If `request` fails first time than `retry` will call `request` one more time while calls count less than 3.

```javascript
import { put, retry } from 'redux-saga/effects'
import { request } from 'some-api';

function* retrySaga(data) {
  try {
    const SECOND = 1000
    const response = yield retry(3, 10 * SECOND, request, data)
    yield put({ type: 'REQUEST_SUCCESS', payload: response })
  } catch(error) {
    yield put({ type: 'REQUEST_FAIL', payload: { error } })
  }
}
```

#### Notes
`retry` is a high-level API built using `delay` and `call`. [Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effects](/docs/recipes/#retrying-xhr-calls)
